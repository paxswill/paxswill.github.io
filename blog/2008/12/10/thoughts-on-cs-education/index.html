<p>I was reading <a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/features/print.php/12297_3789981_1">this</a> article
 a bit ago. In it Bjarne Stroustrup talks about the inadequacies of American
<span class="caps">CS</span> education. One point he brings up resonated with me. 
<!--more-->
I took <span class="caps">AP</span> Computer Science A and <span class="caps">AB</span> (in Java) in high school, and something we
learned  early on was how to make our code look nice. Ideally, we didn’t put
comments on the same line as code, and in <span class="caps">AB</span>, we had to document each method
with preconditions, post conditions, and a general description of the method.
While occasionally (and especially on the final project), the better practices
fell to the wayside, we wrote nice code. Right now, I’m finishing up my first
semester of college (intending to major in Computer Engineering), and noticed
a jump between how I was taught <span class="caps">CS</span> in high school and how <span class="caps">CS</span> is taught in
higher education. I took a <span class="caps">CS</span> course that was taught in C++, but we never
talked about code style. We were referred to the textbook, which had a couple
pages on it, but these were mostly what to comment. There was none of the
things I was taught in Java, about you keep class data private, and segment
everything into easily reusable parts. We were taught to just bang out code.
One of my friends at another school was learning Java for the first time, and
he had to write a class that held temperature data. He didn’t know what
getters and setters were, and why you keep data private. The main class and the
utility class were so interwoven, it would be near impossible to separate&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>While most of us who took <span class="caps">CS</span> in my high school disliked how our teacher taught
us, I now see why she went through all the little steps. People in my C++ class
didn’t know why we used ints or longs, and what overflow is. All of us in <span class="caps">AP</span> <span class="caps">CS</span>
could count in binary, and change bases at will. We didn’t learn about bitwise 
operations in high school, but when I read about them now, I know why you can
divide by two with a bitshift. Thanks Mrs.&nbsp;C.</p>
