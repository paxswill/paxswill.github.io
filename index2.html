<p>Weekend project I made: <a href="https://github.com/paxswill/cwavelet">cWavelet</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple wavelet library written in pure C. I&#8217;ve been trying to wrap
 my head around wavelets off and on for about three months, and I finally 
got them enough to write a library. It is still being developed, but it does
 simple forward transforms (as far as I can tell correctly) right now. In the 
future, I hope to implement portions of it in OpenCL and/or <span class="caps">MPI</span> so I can
 try it out on the clusters at&nbsp;school.</p>

<p>The Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X install on my Mini 9 was recently borked (friend was borrowing it,
and an unclean shutdown corrupted the file system), and I didn&#8217;t have the
install discs on me. I&#8217;d also been messing with the Lucid Lynx beta in a <span class="caps">VM</span> on
my machine, and was very impressed with the level of polish, so I decided to
install Ubuntu on the Mini again and see how it went.
<!--more-->
This was a couple days before the release date, so I downloaded the release
candidate and ran from there. I&#8217;ve used both the normal desktop and netbook
remix in previous versions of Ubuntu, and for my workflow I prefer using the 
normal desktop. As there isn&#8217;t a desktop .img available, I downloaded the
desktop <span class="caps">ISO</span> and used the <span class="caps">USB</span> IMage Writer in my <span class="caps">VM</span> to copy the <span class="caps">ISO</span> to a flash
drive. Installation had a minor hitch in that the first install didn&#8217;t seem to 
take, in that after the installer was finished and the system rebooted, nothing
showed up. I booted to the <span class="caps">USB</span> stick again, reinstalled, and everything worked 
after&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Hardware support is very much improved in this version (I&#8217;ve previously used
8.04 and 9.04). I didn&#8217;t have to make any configuration changes to use sound
hardware, Bluetooth 
worked right away, 3D acceleration was a given as I have an Intel <span class="caps">GPU</span>, and
after I installed the Broadcom <span class="caps">STA</span> driver through the restricted driver 
installer, Wifi worked as well. Sleep works as well as it did under 9.10, as
having an <span class="caps">SD</span> card mounted when you try sleeping causes the suspend process to
hang. The fix is detailed in <a href="http://www.mydellmini.com/forum/ubuntu-netbook-remix/14722-suspend-hibernate-mini-9-broken-3.html#post143677">this</a> MyDellMini forum post. Reproduced
here, the fix is to add a hook to the sleep process that unmounts all memory
cards. Put the following script in the <code>/etc/pm/sleep.d/</code> directory.  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="k">case</span> <span class="nv">$1</span> in
hibernate|suspend<span class="o">)</span>
umount /dev/mmcblk*
    ;;
<span class="c">#    thaw|resume)</span>
<span class="c">#        ;;</span>
*<span class="o">)</span>  <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$1</span>
    ;;
<span class="k">esac</span>
<span class="nb">exit </span>0
</pre></div>


<p>Then make it&nbsp;executable.</p>
<p>Addendum: Turned out it wasn&#8217;t a bout of file system madness, it was the <span class="caps">SSD</span> dying.
 I sent it into Dell and got it back a week and a half&nbsp;later.</p>
