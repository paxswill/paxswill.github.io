Weekend project I made: [cWavelet](https://github.com/paxswill/cwavelet).

It's a simple wavelet library written in pure C. I've been trying to wrap
 my head around wavelets off and on for about three months, and I finally 
got them enough to write a library. It is still being developed, but it does
 simple forward transforms (as far as I can tell correctly) right now. In the 
future, I hope to implement portions of it in OpenCL and/or MPI so I can
 try it out on the clusters at school.
