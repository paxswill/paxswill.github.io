I was reading <a href='http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/features/print.php/12297_3789981_1'>this</a> article
 a bit ago. In it Bjarne Stroustrup talks about the inadequacies of American CS education. One point he brings
 up resonated with me.

I took AP Computer Science A and AB (in Java) in high school, and something we learned 
early on was how to make our code look nice. Ideally, we didn’t put comments on the same line as code, and in 
AB, we had to document each method with preconditions, post conditions, and a general description of the 
method. While occasionally (and especially on the final project), the better practices fell to the wayside,
 we wrote nice code. Right now, I’m finishing up my first semester of college (intending to major in Computer
 Engineering), and noticed a jump between how I was taught CS in high school and how CS is taught in higher
 education. I took a CS course that was taught in C++, but we never talked about code style. We were referred
 to the textbook, which had a couple pages on it, but these were mostly what to comment. There was none of the
 things I was taught in Java, about you keep class data private, and segment everything into easily reusable
 parts. We were taught to just bang out code. One of my friends at another school was learning Java for the 
first time, and he had to write a class that held temperature data. He didn’t know what getters and setters 
were, and why you keep data private. The main class and the utility class were so interwoven, it would be near
 impossible to separate them.

While most of us who took CS in my high school disliked how our teacher taught us, I now see why she went 
through all the little steps. People in my C++ class didn’t know why we used ints or longs, and what overflow
 is. All of us in AP CS could count in binary, and change bases at will. We didn’t learn about bitwise 
operations in high school, but when I read about them now, I know why you can divide by two with <<1. Thanks Mrs. C.
